# Welcome to my Data Science space!

My name is Radhika Satapathy. I am an engineer and data scientist by training, with over 6 years of professional experience in software product engineering, business systems analysis and implementation of ERP systems for supply chain management. I recently completed a masters program in data science from the University of California, Berkeley. The world of data and analysis continues to fascinate me. This repository contains some of my recent work.

1. Airline Delay Prediction: predicting airline departure delays. Yes, waiting and re-booking is such a pain!
2. Avocados Galore: a market entry analysis for the favorite fruit-veggie. Perhaps goji berries will be next.
3. BikeShare: an analysis of trips for improving ridership. More exercise, less pollution - what not to love!
